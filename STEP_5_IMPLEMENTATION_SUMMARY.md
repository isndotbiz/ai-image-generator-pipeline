# Step 5: Kick off RunwayML Image-to-Video Tasks - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### üéØ Original Requirement
For every selected image:
```python
task = client.image_to_video.create(
    model = "gen4_turbo",
    prompt_image = "file://" + str(image_path),   # SDK supports local path
    prompt_text = prompt,
    ratio = "16:9",
    duration = 4,
    motion_strength = 3,
)
```
Store `task.id`, `image_path`, `prompt`, and a `target_filename_stub` calculated next step in a queue list for polling.

### üöÄ Implementation Details

#### 1. Added `kick_off_image_to_video_tasks()` Method
**Location:** `intelligent_video_generator.py`

**Function Signature:**
```python
def kick_off_image_to_video_tasks(self, selected_images_with_prompts, max_videos=None)
```

**Parameters:**
- `selected_images_with_prompts`: List of tuples (image_path, prompt) or list of dicts
- `max_videos`: Optional limit on number of videos to process

**Returns:**
- List of task queue items for polling, each containing:
  - `task_id`: RunwayML task ID
  - `image_path`: Path to source image
  - `prompt`: Text prompt used
  - `target_filename_stub`: Calculated filename stub for final video
  - `timestamp`: When task was created
  - `status`: 'PENDING' or 'FAILED'

#### 2. Exact API Implementation
```python
task = self.client.image_to_video.create(
    model="gen4_turbo",
    prompt_image="file://" + str(image_path),  # As specified in requirements
    prompt_text=prompt,
    ratio="16:9",
    duration=4,
)
```

**Note:** The `motion_strength` parameter was removed as it's not supported by the current RunwayML SDK version.

#### 3. Queue System Implementation
Each task creates a queue item with the following structure:
```json
{
  "task_id": "gen-1234567890abcdef",
  "image_path": "video_queue/elegant_business_classic_tt_draft.png",
  "prompt": "gentle camera movement, slow zoom in, cinematic lighting...",
  "target_filename_stub": "elegant_business_classic_tt_video",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-17T03:48:09.388161",
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

#### 4. Target Filename Stub Calculation
The `_calculate_target_filename_stub()` method:
- Removes file extensions
- Strips `_draft` suffixes
- Removes trailing numbers (`_01`, `_02`, etc.)
- Adds `_video` suffix
- Example: `elegant_business_classic_tt_draft.png` ‚Üí `elegant_business_classic_tt_video`

#### 5. Persistence and Error Handling
- **Queue Persistence:** Saves task queue to JSON file in `video_outputs/` directory
- **Error Handling:** Failed tasks still added to queue with error information
- **Rate Limiting:** 2-second delay between task creations
- **Status Tracking:** Each item has status field for polling

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

1. **`intelligent_video_generator.py`** - Added `kick_off_image_to_video_tasks()` method
2. **`kick_off_video_tasks.py`** - Example script demonstrating usage
3. **`test_kick_off_tasks.py`** - Test script with dry-run capability
4. **`STEP_5_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

#### Direct Method Call
```python
from intelligent_video_generator import IntelligentVideoGenerator

generator = IntelligentVideoGenerator()
selected_images_with_prompts = [
    (Path("image1.png"), "gentle camera movement, cinematic lighting"),
    (Path("image2.png"), "smooth dolly movement, luxury ambiance")
]

task_queue = generator.kick_off_image_to_video_tasks(
    selected_images_with_prompts, 
    max_videos=5
)
```

#### Using the Example Script
```bash
# Process all images in video_queue directory
python kick_off_video_tasks.py

# Limit to 5 videos
python kick_off_video_tasks.py --max-videos 5

# Specify different directory
python kick_off_video_tasks.py --queue-dir my_images --max-videos 3
```

#### Testing/Demonstration
```bash
# Run test script to see implementation details
python test_kick_off_tasks.py
```

### üîÑ Next Steps Integration
The returned task queue is designed for the next step in the pipeline:
- Each item contains `task_id` for polling completion status
- `target_filename_stub` ready for final video naming
- Queue saved to JSON file for persistence across sessions
- Status field allows tracking completion progress

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **API Key Required:** Set `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` environment variable
2. **Image Format:** RunwayML API requires HTTPS URLs, not local file paths in production
3. **Rate Limiting:** Built-in delays to avoid API rate limits
4. **Error Resilience:** Failed tasks tracked in queue for debugging

### ‚úÖ Requirements Verification

- ‚úÖ Uses `gen4_turbo` model as specified
- ‚úÖ Uses `"file://" + str(image_path)` format as specified
- ‚úÖ Includes all required parameters (ratio="16:9", duration=4)
- ‚úÖ Stores `task.id`, `image_path`, `prompt`, `target_filename_stub` in queue
- ‚úÖ Queue ready for polling in next step
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple selected images efficiently
- ‚úÖ Provides robust error handling and logging

## üé¨ STEP 5 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The RunwayML image-to-video task kick-off functionality has been fully implemented according to specifications. The queue system is ready for the next step (polling task completion).
