## 1. Silk & Control

Flux Prompt:
Photorealistic image of an elegant woman lounging on a chaise in a marble room with floor-to-ceiling windows and soft white curtains. She's wearing a silk champagne-colored robe that drapes naturally. A single gold anklet is visible. She’s sipping espresso, gazing at the viewer with slight amusement, one eyebrow raised. Ambient sunlight dances across her skin, revealing skin texture, natural pores, and soft shadows.

Runway Gen‑3 Prompt:
10-second cinematic pan from feet (with anklet) to her face. Curtains flutter. Espresso steam rises gently. Natural sunlight glows softly across the room.

## 6. Leather & Ledger

Flux Prompt:
In a high-end office, she sits in a tall leather chair with an open ledger on the desk. She glances sideways with a calculating expression. Her fingers toy with a fountain pen. Dark ambient lighting defines cheekbone texture and posture.
